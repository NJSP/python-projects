# Prompt: 

You are tasked with creating a Python program for a fantasy video game called "Realm of Wonders." The game features a procedurally generated world map that players can explore. The map should be a 20x20 grid where each cell can be one of several terrain types: Grass, Water, Mountain, Forest, Desert, Swamp, and Lava. The terrain types should be distributed based on predefined probabilities. Additionally, the map should include a river that starts from one edge of the map and flows to another edge, ensuring it doesn't intersect itself. The program should ask the player a series of questions in the beginning like "Do you prefer warm climates or cold climates?" and use those answers to influence the world generations.

The program should also implement a pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path between two points on the map, avoiding Water, Mountain, and Lava terrains. The path should be displayed on the map. 

Furthermore, the program should simulate dynamic events such as earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions. Earthquakes can turn Grass into Mountain and Forest into Swamp, while floods can turn Desert into Water and Grass into Swamp. Volcanic eruptions can turn any terrain into Lava. These events should be randomly triggered and affect the map and pathfinding

To add more complexity, the program should also include a feature to simulate weather effects. The weather can be Sunny, Rainy, or Snowy, and it should affect the movement cost of the pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Rainy weather increases the cost of moving through Forest and Swamp, while Snowy weather increases the cost of moving through Grass and Desert).

The program should then print a creative description of the map in the style of a D&D dungeon master. The description should include locations of major terrain features such as Mountains and Swamps, using cardinal directions to describe their location on the map.

Finally, the program should take an input from the user in the form of a cardinal direction (North, South, East, West) that represents the player moving through the world. The program should then describe where on the map the player is and what type of terrain is around them. Every time the player moves through the world there is a random chance for a dynamic event or weather change that can alter the map.

# Requirements:

1. Generate a 20x20 grid map with the specified terrain types based on predefined probabilities and the user's answers to questions.
2. Ensure the river flows from one edge of the map to another without intersecting itself. 
3. Implement the pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path between two points, avoiding Water, Mountain, and Lava terrains. 
4. Display the map with the path found by the pathfinding algorithm. 
5. Simulate dynamic events (earthquakes, floods, and volcano eruptions) that alter the terrain and affect pathfinding. 
6. Print a creative description of the map in the style of a D&D dungeon master and give the map a cool name
7. Include functionality for the user to move through the map using cardinal directions and allow the world to be changed dynamically by random chance after every movement.

# Notes: 

1. The terrain types should be represented by single letters: G (Grass), W (Water), M (Mountain), F (Forest), D (Desert), S (Swamp), L (Lava). 
2. The river should be represented by 'R' and should flow from one edge to another without intersecting itself. 
3. The path should be represented by 'P' and should avoid Water, Mountain, and Lava terrains. 
4. The weather effects should be simulated by altering the movement costs in the pathfinding algorithm.
5. The program should not use a simple Wave Function Collapse algorithm to generate the map.
6. The program should not use A* pathfinding.

# Backstory: 
In the "Realm of Wonders," the world is constantly changing due to natural events and weather conditions. As an adventurer, you must navigate through this ever-changing landscape to reach your destination. The terrain types and dynamic events add to the challenge, making each journey unique. The weather conditions further complicate your travels, requiring you to adapt your strategy based on the current weather.
